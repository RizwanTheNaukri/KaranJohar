Description 

ABSTRACT       
It provides total functionality, on the prevalence of salmonella spp. In polluted brackish water ecosystem. The present study includes detection of salmonella pathogen by isolation, identification and molecular characterization of salmonella isolates from brackish water samples. It was found that PCR based on invA gene was found to be specific and sensitive method for detection of salmonella. It is a quality control check in every food based industry.

DETAILS
Seafood derived from wild fish as well as farmed fish has always been an important source of protein in the human diet. On a global scale, fish and fish products are the most important source of protein and it is estimated that more than 30% of fish for human consumption comes from aquaculture. The food borne pathogens cause serious health risks and are important public health concerns worldwide .Salmonella infections are a frequent cause of food borne outbreaks and affect several million people worldwide each year. Since failure to detect evidence of Salmonella and Shigella species is generally regarded as an indication of the safety of the fish and shellfish with regard to pathogenic bacteria, the present study was taken up with the following objectives
•	To isolate and identify Salmonella spp. from fish, shrimp and crabs

100 samples of fish,shrimp and crab were collected and intestinal tissues are extracted for sample preparation.samples were pre-enriched and isolated on selective medias , then identified by gram staining and biochemical tests.Molecular detection of pathogeneic bacteria is done by PCR by initially extracting DNA and run on agarose gel electrophoresis.

•	Molecular typing of Salmonella isolates

Typing was performed by RAPD. The data obtained from amplification products by primers were used to estimate genetic relatedness of Salmonella isolates, isolated from different sources. The RAPD pattern was  scored on the basis of presence or absence of bands.The percentage of similarities among the strains was determined by construction of dendogram.

•	Antibiogram of Salmonella isolates


Training
Did a 15 days training programme  on molecular biological techniques in Sangene Bio-tech, Bangalore. It included media preparations, DNA extraction from plants and chicken blood, m-RNA extraction, m-RNA cloning, running on agarose gel electrophoresis, checking the purity of DNA and RNA in nano drop spectroscopy.
