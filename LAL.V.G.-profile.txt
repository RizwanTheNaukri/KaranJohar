I have joined Indo  German Tool Room & Mafatlal Micron in the project  level
as the  first employee in the Administrative Department.  Therefore,  I  got
an  opportunity  to design, implement and  streamline the activities of  the
department after taking  permission from higher  authorities  and  the  same
system is being followed now.

I  believe   to  have  a  proper  system,  which  should  be  followed,  for
effective   monitoring   of  the  functions.   Following   are   the    main
functions where I contributed substantially.

a.    *_Recruitment procedure_*.

      I have completed the recruitment   procedures  of  the  employees  who
      joined prior to my  appointment  viz,  police  verification,  personal
      file, service book, roster etc.  A suitable system  has been developed
      and  the same is being followed.



b.    *_Statutory recruitments_*.

      Completed all statutory requirements like  obtaining  factory  license
      from factory inspector office, registration under Contract Labour  Act
      for contractual employees, registration of  ESI,  implemented  minimum
      wages for contractual    employees,  personal  accident  policy,  fire
      policy etc.  The renewal of  license,  other  required  registers  and
      forms, returns etc.  are monitored  properly in a systematic way.

c.    *_Housekeeping._*

      We have engaged 17 contract labours for housekeeping.  Since  IGTR  is
      located in industrial and polluted area, this is an important activity
      to  keep  our  premises  neat  and  hygienic.   I  have  designed  and
      implemented a structured plan for effective monitoring of this system.

d.    *_Security._*

       Proper  structured  security  system  has  been   implemented.    The
      activities like visitors control, gate  pass,  student control,  guest
      house etc. are co-ordinated  with  security personnel.

e.    *_Canteen_*

      I have formed a committee of our students and they  are  managing  the
      activities of canteen.

f.    *_Legal_*

      I have attended successfully six labour cases  at  Labour  Office  for
      IGTR.


g.    *_Horticulture_*.

        I  have  formed  a  horticulture  committee  and  approached  forest
      department for plants etc.  This  activity   is  very  important   for
      escaping  from heat, dust and pollution.  Now I have  converted   this
      area into a garden.

h.    *_Sports & Games activities_*.

       I have   organised indoor games activities for the   last  six  years
      for our trainees and staff.    We are also planning  to form  team for
      cricket, football, badminton etc.  for open competition.


Since I joined in the project level I have taken initiative  to  design  and
implement and   all the activities of Administrative Department.
