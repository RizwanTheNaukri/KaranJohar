Academic Qualifications:

I have completed my graduation in physics from Utkal University,  Orissa  in
1992 and Post graduation from Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi with  Material
Science as special paper  in  1995.  Then  I  joined  Institute  For  Plasma
Research as a Technical Trainee in 1997, in which the  training  for  multi-
disciplinary courses was provided. After  completion  of  training  for  the
period of 1 year, I am continuing as a Scientist.


                          Computational Experience:

 • Good knowledge of FORTRAN and BASIC programming languages.
 • Comprehensive exposure to Internet and HTML.
 • Experience in Web Page design.
 • Good knowledge in LINUX and DOS systems,  Windows  for  Work  Group,  and
   Windows95 systems.
 • Extensive hands on experience on MSOffice applications  like  MSWord,  MS
   Power Point, MS Excel, MS Project etc.
 • Experience in AutoCAD-R14 and higher versions for drawings.



              Working Experience at and after Post-graduation:

1. Project work:

   Preparation and characterization of  high  TC  thin  film  superconductor
   Yba2Cu3O7-(.

   Place: National physical Lab. (NPL), New Delhi
   Duration: 6 months

2. Experience during research:

   Preparation of thin film targets of different  materials  for  heavy  ion
   bombardment experiment.

    Place: Nuclear Science Center (NSC), New Delhi.
    Duration: 1 & 1/2 years

3. Selection as a Scientist at Institute For Plasma Research (IPR) in 1997:

   Different courses studied during Training

   a. One-year course work in  different  fields  like  vacuum  Technology,
      Instrumentation, Computer, Electronics etc.
   b. Project work on "Computer  particle  simulation  of  large  amplitude
      burst in a cold inhomogeneous plasma".
        In  this  project,  I  have  studied  nonlinear   electron   plasma
      oscillation in an inhomogeneous non-relativistic plasma as well as  in
      a relativistic homogeneous plasma and also done simulation of the same
      using a 1-D relativistic particle-in-cell code.
        The  non-relativistic   problem   of   large   amplitude   electron
      oscillations in a cold homogeneous plasma is solved by transforming to
      Lagrangian  coordinates.  The  results  show  that,  if  the   initial
      conditions are set up in such a way that the electron  orbits  do  not
      cross in the course of motion, then the plasma  exhibits  stable.  The
      situation changes drastically in the presence of a cold  inhomogeneous
      background.
        For  a  sinusoidal  in-homogeneity,   the   problem   of   electron
      oscillations was exactly solved by  Infeld  and  the  results  show  a
      series of density bursts. A similar kind of situation arises in a cold
      homogeneous relativistic plasma.

4. Working experience as Scientist for vacuum group:

   a. Design of Gas-feed system for super-conducting steady  state  (SST-1)
      tokamak and the exhaust line for  hydrogen  and  other  gases  during
      plasma discharge operation.
   b. Fabrication follow up and testing of SST-1 tokamak prototype and main
      vacuum vessel and LN2 panels  for  shielding  of  superconducting  TF
      coils.
   c.  Internal  report  entitled  "Vacuum  Protocol  for  SST-1"  for  the
      materials to be used in  Ultra  high  vacuum  (UHV)  system  to  meet
      necessary compatibility.
   d. Lecture on vacuum technology for Technical Trainee Program from  last
      two years and also this year.


5. Paper presentation:

   1. Paper entitled "Performance study of Aluminium wire-seal" is presented
      at IVSNS - 1999 symposium held at CAT, Indore,  India  in  November  -
      1999.

   2. Technical report on “Vacuum Protocol for SST-1”, IPR/TR-72/2001.

      Tokamak” is presented in 3rd IAEA TCM Conference held  at  Griefswald,
      Germany And Arles, France from 2nd to 7th of May 2002.

   4. Paper entitled “Performance study of Piezo-electric gas feed valve  on
      prototype of the SST-1 gas fuelling  system”  is  presented  at  BARC,
      Mumbai, India in 15th to17th of October – 2003.

   5. Paper entitled “ Leak detection of Cryostat chamber and vessel modules
      of  SST-1  Tokamak”  is  presented  in  IVSNS  –  2005  held  at  IPR,
      Gandhinagar, India in 16th to 18th of November – 2005.

   6. Paper entitled “  Helium  leak  testing  of  superconducting  magnets,
      thermal shields and crygenic lines of SST-1” is presented in  IVSNS  –
      2005 held at IPR, Gandhinagar, India in 16th to  18th  of  November  –
      2005.

6. Current work:

   Modification of piezoelectric valve to increase it's throughput for SST-1
   puffing during discharge by  applying  rectangular  pulses  of  different
   shapes and time periods.
